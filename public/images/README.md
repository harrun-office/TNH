# Images Directory

Place your image files here. Images in the `public/images/` folder can be referenced directly in your components using paths like `/images/filename.jpg`.

For the home page hero section, add your building image as:
- `building-chennai-1.jpg` (or any name you prefer)

The image will be displayed in the hero overlay section with a green gradient overlay on top.
